This program implements the classic random forest algorithm to classify
activities based on sensor data. The forest is built using a subspace sampling 
algorithm to create the forest. The trees are built using the classic 
information gain ratio algorithm. They are then pruned using the reduced error 
rate validation algoithm. The forest was then tested on a group of samples 
held out of the trainign set to create a confusion matrix and F statistic. All
code was written from scratch in order to learn the algorithms.

The program input in a single CSV file showing senor and demographic data of
test subjects, and the activity category, as each row. The data came from a 
public data set available here:

It formed the basis of the following paper:

To run it: python ActivityClassifier.py <name of data file>

Like all random forests, the program is both incredibly accurate and incredibly
slow to train. The final confusion matrix and statistics were as follows:
